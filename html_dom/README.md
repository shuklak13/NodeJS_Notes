# What is the HTML DOM?

Javascript can use a webpage's **DOM**, or **Document Object Model**, to create dynamic HTML.

**HTML elements** are defined as **objects** inside the DOM.

The DOM gives you **methods** to interact with these **objects** and access their **properties** and **events**.

# Tags, IDs, Classes, Hooks?

Tags, IDs, and Classes are HTML attributes.

**Tags** define the type of HTML element it is, like a list item `li` or a paragraph `p`.

**IDs** are unique identifiers that should not be shared between elements.

**Classes** are groups; several elements can share the same class, and an element can belong to multiple classes.

IDs and Classes are both types of [**hooks**](http://web.simmons.edu/~grabiner/comm244/weekthree/html-hooks.html). Hooks can be used to access particular HTML elements in CSS or Javascript. You can also create hooks with the **div** and **span** HTML tags - they exist purely to serve as hooks, and have no meaning by themselves. Div is a block-level HTML element, while Span is an inline HTML element.
