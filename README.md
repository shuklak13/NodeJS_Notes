# [V8 Engine]

Node.js code is *interpreted* (not compiled!) by Google's open-source **V8 engine**, which converts Javascript code to C++.

Why? Bescause Javascript was intended to be run in the browser, not in the server, unlike C++. V8 connects these two, and is used by Node.js to give Javascript the low-level functionality needed to be a useful server language.
